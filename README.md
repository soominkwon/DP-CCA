# Differentially-Private-Canonical-Correlation-Analysis

This repository is for the active research of Differentially Private CCA.

There are no sets of instructions released yet, however, you can run the two files of code.
These codes are written in Python, in the PyCharm IDE.
This project is being advised by Professor Anand D. Sarwate, with PhD candidate Hafiz Imtiaz.


NOTE (1):
The "Part 2" File and the alone Python file are two different codes.

The stand alone Python .py is for calculating the eigenvalues of two randomly generated data.

The "Part 2" File is for calculating the CCA indices for the three .mat files also located in the folder.
Please consider all files before compilation.


NOTE (2):
There will soon be uploaded a Python file and other files with the regard of the COINSTAC framework.
This will save a file, which we will use the popular K-means clustering algorithm on the saved file.
